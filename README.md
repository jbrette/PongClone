# PongClone

A simple clone program of the original 1972 Atari game Pong written and coded in Python 3.7.4 with Jupyter Notebook.

Currently makes use of the 'turtle', 'random' and 'os' Python modules.

Can be played single player, with 2 people or let the computer face itself.

There are 2 AI modes so far:
  The first 'cheats' in that it knows where the ball is at all time, much like a human player does with their eyes.
  The second predicts where the ball will be given its trajectory and possible bounces.


Also has a secondary 'Advanced' mode where the paddles may also move left and right.
